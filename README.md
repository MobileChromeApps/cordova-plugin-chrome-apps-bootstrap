# Integration layer for Chrome Apps in Cordova

This plugin contains the code used to wrap a Chrome app and make it run using
Cordova. It is meant to be used with the `cca` tool, and isn't useful outside
the context of a mobile Chrome App.

## Status

The support for various functionality, across platforms, is summarized in the table below.

| API | Android | iOS  |
| -------------- |:-------:|:----:|
| AppWindow: hide, minimize, restore, show | Yes     | No-op<sup>1</sup> |
| AppWindow: all other methods      | No      | No   |
**Notes:**

1. The [iOS Human Interaction Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/StartingStopping.html)
    do not allow apps to show/hide/close programmatically.
    Thus, these methods are implemented as a no-op
    (will execute without error on iOS, but have no behavior)

The API references are:
